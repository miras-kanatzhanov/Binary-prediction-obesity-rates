# Binary-prediction-obesity-rates

Regardless of the findings of our research, the created models are still vulnerable to limitations and there is space for future advancements. To see if such features of our research have any success, the methodology can be further improved by exposing the model with more factors that have been theoretically proven to influence obesity; such models can investigate the connection between genetics and obesity and refer our research in a global scale by showing how genetic and evolutionary factors around the globe impact the prediction of obesity. Moreover, demographic indicators can be further expanded to sociological factors where the effects of a ban or limit on fast food consumption and advertisements can be assessed in further research. Last but not least, even though the research is limited with the unique features of the Dutch population, since it presents a framework for future research, the methodology can be applied to different regions and countries. Thus, it may be beneficial to conduct the same methodology in a cross-sectional analysis by applying to different countries so that the results can be generalized.
